A Burp extension for testing Umbraco Dependency Handler.

https://markitzeroday.com/umbraco/lfi/2017/05/01/umbraco-lfi-exploitation.html

Allows you to enter a URL or path in a Burp tool and it auto base64 encodes the file path parameter. Affects all tools except Proxy, so useful passing a file path list to Intruder, etc.

More to come - very early alpha.
